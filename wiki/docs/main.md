# Welcome to your Markdown Wiki
["Read Me" File](./README.md).

## What is this?
This is a stupid demo of how one can turn apache2 server into a personal wiki using markdown, one php file, and a few directives in your apache config.  

## Why?

I created this a few years back (ok almost 10) because i was bored and was making an uneccesary point to a colleage for shits and giggles).  

Now im just trying to figure out gitpod and practice docker config.


If you are looking for my resume, then please forget you saw this. 

Thank  you :-D
